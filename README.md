# Front End Engineering Challenge 
####  Brendan Bohn

## Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Libraries
- jQuery

## Goal of this project:
Create a navbar with which a user can log in and log out.

## Choices

I decided not to use Bootstrap or any other template to challenge myself. I did use jQuery though, which just made selecting html easier.

## To-Do
- add animation/transitions to make the interaction richer for the user
